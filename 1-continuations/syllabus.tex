\begin{abstract}
\enquote{The seminar will provide a venue for discussing various mechanisms for scope-taking and projection, taking as our starting point continuations -- a perspective on scope-taking developed by Chris Barker and Chung-chieh Shan. We will attempt to develop a solid working knowledge of the relevant mechanics, as well as arrive at a comprehensive empirical assessment of their advantages and drawbacks in selected areas of application. These will include quantifier scope, variable binding, cross-over, and presupposition projection, paying particular attention to linearity effects which continuations are designed to handle in a principled manner.}
\end{abstract}

\section{Requirements}

\subsection{General}

Students should attend and participate (obviously!). There will also
be occasional homework assignments, consisting of either (i) a p-set, or (ii)
submitting questions on an assigned reading. These will usually be due back the
day before the following class.

\subsection{Student presentations}

For the registered students, we expect two things:

\begin{itemize}

  \item A presentation in class.

  \item Eventually, a term paper.

\end{itemize}

We've blocked out the final two weeks of the seminar for student presentations,
but this is mutable. The presentation may take one of two forms: (a)
leading discussion of a paper relevant to the term paper topic, (b)
presentation of WiP ideas that will eventually take the form of a term paper.
Just to emphasise, we don't expect the latter kind of presentation to be
especially polished or complete. Something more exploratory is fine. Given that
there are four registered students, each presentation should be around one hour long.


\section{Tentative schedule}

The first few weeks are fairly stable, but later weeks will probably
shift.\sidenote{Note, Patrick is down as teaching \textit{crossover i}, but will
be at a conference that week, so this session will need to be rescheduled. We'll
be in touch about that soon.}
